# prestar-lan
This is my CS:S LAN server for bhop. It is preconfigured so hopefully you won't have to do anything.
This is your standard run-of-the-mill shavit bhop server

## Install Guide
1. Download this repo
2. Drag the file into the Counter-Strike Source folder in your Steam directory
Have fun :)

## Features
- External TAS Tools, better than the stock shavit checkpoints, can also be used for segging
- In game map downloader, accessible with /getmap
- Configured to SJ standards, hopefully
- Miscellaneous styles nobody cares about
- WRSJ preconfigured (wont work all the time for some reason might have something to do with it being a listenserver)

## TAS Tool Guidance
Load the tool by using "meta load addons/tas".
Type "tas" for a list of commands, bind them to whatever.

## Plugin Credits
i'll do this later idk
